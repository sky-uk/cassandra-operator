# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a GitHub
issue before making a change.  This saves everyone from wasted effort in the event that the proposed
changes need some adjustment before they are ready for submission.
All new code, including changes to existing code, should be tested and have a corresponding test added or updated where applicable.


## Prerequisites

The following must be installed on your development machine:

- `go` (>=1.15)
- `docker`
- `jdk-11` or above
- `gcc` (or `build-essential` package on debian distributions)
- `kubectl`
- `curl`
- `rsync`
- `goss`

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

## Building and Testing

To setup your environment with the required dependencies, run this at the project root level.
_Missing system libraries that need installing will be listed in the output_
```
make setup
```

To compile, and create local docker images for each of the sub-projects:
```
make install
```

To run code style checks on all sub-projects:
```
make check-style
```

To run all tests on all sub-projects:
```
make check
```

To run unit tests for the cassandra-operator sub-project:
```
make -C cassandra-operator test
```

### Cross Compiling

By default, the operator's Go binaries will be built for the Linux operating system and AMD64 architecture. If you need
to build for any other operating system or architecture, set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as required
before invoking `make`.

### End-to-End Testing

An end-to-end testing approach is used wherever possible.
The end-to-end tests are run in parallel in order to the reduce build time as much as possible.
End-to-end tests are by default run against a local [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster using a [fake-cassandra-docker](fake-cassandra-docker/README.md) image to speed up testing.

To prepare your test environment you must run the setup and install from the Building and Testing section:
```
make setup install
``` 
These commands start the kind registry and push the test images needed in to that registry.

To create a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) Kubernetes cluster:
```
make kind
```

The tests require the cassandra-operator to be deployed in to the kind cluster:
```
make -C cassandra-operator deploy-operator
```

To run all end-to-end tests for the cassandra-operator sub-project:
```
make -C cassandra-operator e2e-test
```

To run a single test suite: 
```
E2E_TEST=modification make -C cassandra-operator e2e-test-parallel
```
 
By default, all test images are built and pushed with a version corresponding to the current commit. 
Kind nodes will cache these image versions and our deployment policy is intentionally `IfNotPresent`, which may not be practical for iterative development. 
You can set image versions to use `latest` for your local development and testing, which should always pull the image replacing the image on the node cache:
```
GIT_REV_OR_OVERRIDE=latest make setup install
GIT_REV_OR_OVERRIDE=latest make -C cassandra-operator deploy-operator
```

Additional flags are available to make it possible to run the tests against your own Kubernetes cluster using docker images from your custom repository.
For instance, if you want to run a full build against your cluster with the default `cassandra:3.11` Cassandra image, use this:
```
USE_MOCK=false POD_START_TIMEOUT=5m DOMAIN=mydomain.com KUBE_CONTEXT=k8Context TEST_REGISTRY=myregistry.com/cassandra-operator-test make
```
... where the available flags are:

Flag | Meaning | Default
---|---|---
`USE_MOCK`                     | Whether the Cassandra pods created in the tests should use a `fake-cassandra-docker` image. If true, you can further specify which image to use via the `FAKE_CASSANDRA_IMAGE` flag | `true`
`CASSANDRA_BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE` | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-bootstrapper` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-bootstrapper:v$(gitRev)`
`FAKE_CASSANDRA_IMAGE`         | The fully qualified name for the `fake-cassandra-docker` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/fake-cassandra:v$(gitRev)`
`CASSANDRA_SNAPSHOT_IMAGE`     | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-snapshot` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-snapshot:v$(gitRev)`
`CASSANDRA_SIDECAR_IMAGE`      | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-sidecar` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-sidecar:v$(gitRev)`
`POD_START_TIMEOUT`            | The max duration allowed for a Cassandra pod to start. The time varies depending on whether a real or fake cassandra image is used and whether PVC or empty dir is used for the cassandra volumes. As a starting point use 150s for fake cassandra otherwise 5m | `150s`
`DOMAIN`                       | Domain name used to create the test operator ingress host | `localhost`
`KUBE_CONTEXT`                 | The Kubernetes context where the test operator will be deployed | `kind`
`KUBECONFIG`                   | The Kubernetes config location where the target `KUBE_CONTEXT` is defined | `$(HOME)/.kube/config`
`TEST_REGISTRY`                | The name of the docker registry where test images created via the build will be pushed| `localhost:5000`
`DOCKER_USERNAME`              | The docker username allowed to push to the release registry | (provided as encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`)
`DOCKER_PASSWORD`              | The password for the docker username allowed to push to the release registry | (provided as encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`)
`GINKGO_COMPILERS`             | Ginkgo `-compilers` value to use when compiling multiple tests suite | `0`, equivalent to not setting the option at all
`GINKGO_NODES`                 | Ginkgo `-nodes` value to use when running tests suite in parallel using the `-p` option. Use a value greater than `1` to specify the level of parallelism. Use `0` or `1` to disable paralellism. | (no default), equivalent to using as many nodes as cpus
`E2E_TEST`                     | Name of the end-to-end test suite to run. Use this to run a specific test suite | empty, equivalent to running all test suites
`SKIP_PACKAGES`                | Comma-separated list of relative package names of tests which should be skipped, e.g. `SKIP_PACKAGES=test/e2e/parallel/validation,test/e2e/parallel/modification` | empty, equivalent to running all test suites
`GIT_REV_OR_OVERRIDE`          | Whether the build / push / deploy logic should use an override version for `dockerTestImage`. If not set it will use a version referencing the current git commit | `v$(gitRev)`
`MAX_CASSANDRA_NODES_PER_NS`   | How many cassandra nodes the e2e-test will attempt to start in parallel. Only increase this if the target namespace has resource capacity | `6` 


## What to work on

If you want to get involved but are not sure on what issue to pick up,
you should look for an issue with a `good first issue` or `bug` label.

## Pull Request Process

1. If your changes include multiple commits, please squash them into a single commit.  Stack Overflow
   and various blogs can help with this process if you're not already familiar with it.
2. Update the README.md / WIKI where relevant.
3. When submitting your pull request, please provide a comment which describes the change and the problem
   it is intended to resolve. If your pull request is fixing something for which there is a related GitHub issue,
   make reference to that issue with the text "Closes #<issue-number>" in the pull request description.
4. You may merge the pull request to master once a reviewer has approved it. If you do not have permission to
   do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

## Pinning dependencies

Certain dependencies are picky about using exact combinations of package
versions (in particular, `k8s.io/client-go` and `k8s.io/apimachinery`).
See https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/INSTALL.md#go-modules

The `cassandra-operator/hack/pin-dependency.sh` script is useful for managing
and pinning these versions when the time comes to update them.

For example, to pin code-generator dependencies:

```bash
./hack/pin-dependency.sh k8s.io/code-generator kubernetes-1.15.0-alpha.1
./hack/pin-dependency.sh k8s.io/client-go kubernetes-1.15.0-alpha.1
./hack/pin-dependency.sh k8s.io/apimachinery kubernetes-1.15.0-alpha.1
```

## Releasing

Only maintainers would need to do this:
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of all the changes that have been merged since the last release
- Tag the master branch with a new version number; this will trigger a new build which will release
docker images labelled after the tag
- Publish the release (via github), referencing issues and contributors

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification, and version numbers
should be chosen accordingly.
